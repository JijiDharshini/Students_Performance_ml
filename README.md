🎓 Students Performance Prediction 📊

> Built entirely using Google Colab on Mobile 📱💻


📌 Overview

Students Performance Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts students' math scores based on their background and preparation data. What makes this project special?

👉 It was entirely built and executed using Google Colab on a mobile phone — no laptop or desktop needed! 💪📱

It walks through everything from data cleaning and visualization to model training and prediction using Python and essential ML libraries.


✨ Features

✅ ZIP upload & auto-extraction
✅ Data preprocessing & label encoding
✅ Heatmap visualization using Seaborn
✅ Linear Regression modeling
✅ Evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error
✅ Prediction on sample student record


📁 Dataset

The dataset contains:

👤 Gender
🌍 Race/Ethnicity
🎓 Parental Level of Education
🍱 Lunch Type
📘 Test Preparation Course
➕ Math Score (target)


📱 Built on Mobile (Colab)

This project proves you can:
-> Run Python notebooks directly on your phone
-> Use Colab’s built-in tools for uploading, coding, and visualization
-> Complete full ML workflows without a computer!


🚀 Getting Started

🧰 Requirements

✓ Python 3.x

✓ Google Colab app or mobile browser

✓ Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn



🔧 Installation & Setup

1. Clone this repo (if using on PC):

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StudentsPerformancePrediction.git
cd StudentsPerformancePrediction

2. Install requirements (if running locally):

pip install -r requirements.txt

> ✅ OR simply open the .ipynb or .py in Google Colab on mobile — no setup required!


▶️ How to Run

1. Upload your ZIP file containing StudentsPerformance.csv
2. Run all code cells:

:) Extract ZIP
:) Read CSV
:) Encode features
:) Plot correlation heatmap
:) Train Linear Regression model
:) Evaluate & predict


📊 Sample Output

🔎 R² Score: Shows model performance
📉 MSE: Measures average prediction error
🎯 Predicted Score: Example result from one student’s data


🔮 Future Work

•Try other models like Random Forest
•Add hyperparameter tuning
•Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
•Build a mobile-friendly front-end!
